This project implements a Task Scheduling System where admins can create tasks, and available workers are assigned based on their execution time and capacity. The system ensures:
Efficient Task Allocation: Assigns tasks to workers with the least load while ensuring they don‚Äôt exceed their capacity.
Queue Management: Tasks are initially marked as "not_assigned" and scheduled dynamically when a worker becomes available.
MongoDB Transactions: Prevents assigning multiple tasks simultaneously before updating worker load.
Greedy Load Based Execution: workers with low load balanced can be allocated to process.
